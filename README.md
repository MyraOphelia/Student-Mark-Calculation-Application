# Student-Mark-Calculation-Application

In manual system calculating marks is very irritating and time wasting so our system 
can solve this problem and calculate the exact mark. The proposed system is an 
application that provides a comprehensive solution to manage and enhance the 
internal mark evaluation. Every semester lecture needs to calculate the internal mark 
of every student. So, a conventional technique to make the calculation for the mark 
to be easier will overcome by this proposed system.
Student Marks Calculation System is just like a calculator that calculate the mark of 
each student in each subject in a particular semester. In this system, lecture need to 
insert the mark and the system will automatically calculate the total of the mark, 
mark average and the last one is grade. Our project target is improving the mark 
calculating system from manual to digital system
